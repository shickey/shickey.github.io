This week, I had the opportunity to spend 5 days down in Austin, Texas for SXSWedu. It was my first time attending the conference and had a blast connecting with like-minded people, building new ideas, and getting down to [brass band covers of Beyoncé](https://www.facebook.com/UrbanAchieversBrassBand). Since it was my first time, I can’t speak from past experience but the general consensus of the attendees was that the conference gets better and better with each year.

Still, when you get a few thousand creative educators and education-related folks at one event, you’re going to get some criticism of the way things are being run. One theme that [bubbled](https://twitter.com/ERHinman/status/441624645741981696) [up](https://twitter.com/EthicaLLC/status/441617233945456642) [through](https://twitter.com/Mason4learning/status/441625334425718784) [twitter](https://twitter.com/EdWeekMMolnar/status/441624679967518720) was the lack of educator voices on some of the panel discussions, especially those about edtech. As [Ann Witherspoon writes](http://www.poweredwithtechnology.com/2014/03/sxsweduan-opportunity-for-educators-to.html), this reinforces a perception that the edtech world does not have educator interests in mind and that the relationship between these two camps continues to be strained, at best. Witherspoon calls for educators to take action by reaching out to edtech companies, bringing them into classrooms, and inviting them to participate in educator-led panels in the future.

Moreover, this tension (real or perceived) points at another issue that I see emerging in the education/edtech world: the lack of educator participation in the _creation_ of new tools. By creation, I do not mean simply providing ideas and feedback to edtech developers and companies on their software (though I do think that dialogue is essential). Rather, I am talking about actually writing code.

Before I became an educator, I worked full time as a software engineer. I am not shy about my criticism of the for-profit software industry; the constant rhetoric declaring the software world to be a meritocracy ignores the institutional sexism and racism present in this sector and as we’ve seen, [algorithms themselves can exhibit racial bias](http://www.nist.gov/manuscript-publication-search.cfm?pub_id=904972). Even the idea that the internet is a bastion of equality fails to recognize the very real issue of access and its intersections with class and race in the offline world.

Still, there is one thing that I believe the software world is doing very right. Namely, it has created a culture of open-sourcing and sharing of not only ideas, but actual products (i.e. code). Implicit in the open-source mentality is the idea that we can do more when we collaborate than we can in isolation — a salient theme for SXSWedu.

When I put myself to the task this week, I could only come up with two examples of truly open-source edtech software projects off the top of my head (Moodle and Koha)*. Granted, there are many more than this, but it is perhaps telling that I can easily rattle off a few dozen open-source projects specific to software development and only two specific to education. Furthermore, this lack of openness does not only apply to edtech software but also to educational materials at large (see [teacherspayteachers.com](http://www.teacherspayteachers.com/)).

Which leads me to the big question:

**Why has education not embraced the open-source culture? Why do we not have more educators participating in these projects?**

Perhaps this question belies my own ignorance of existing projects. In any case, I would love to see more educators working in collaboration to build their own edtech tools. I understand that my path to becoming an educator (software developer to teacher) is not a usual one and that there may not be a lot of educators out there with the necessary skills, but I have a hard time believing that I am the only one. [I certainly don’t believe I’m the only one interested](http://www.ovenell-carter.com/the-app-of-me-and-you/). We CAN do more in community than we can by ourselves. Let’s make it happen!

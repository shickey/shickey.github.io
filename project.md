# Projects

I build stuff sometimes.

## HMMM.js

[HMMM.js](https://github.com/shickey/HMMM.js) is a javascript implementation of the [Harvey-Mudd Miniature Machine](http://www.cs.hmc.edu/~cs5grad/cs5/hmmm/documentation/documentation.html) assembly language. I also built an online simulator for the machine [here](http://shickey.github.io/HMMM.js/).
